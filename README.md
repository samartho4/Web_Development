# Web Development

This repository contains all the code, notes, and related files I created while taking Angela Yu's [The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST12MT122624) course on Udemy. Additionally, it includes resources and knowledge I gained from coursework such as [WEB222: Introduction to Web Programming](https://web222.ca), [WEB322: Web Programming Tools and Frameworks](https://webprogrammingtoolsandframeworks.sdds.ca), and [WEB422: Web Programming for Apps and Services](https://webprogrammingforappsandservices.sdds.ca).
